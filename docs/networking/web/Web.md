[HTTP client]: http/HTTPClient.html
# HTTP
HTTP is the protocol that powers the World Wide Web, allowing communication between web browsers and servers. It's based on a request-response model, where clients request resources (like web pages) from servers, which respond with the requested data. HTTP is stateless, meaning each request is independent, and it uses Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to identify resources. It supports both persistent and non-persistent connections and can be secured using TLS to create HTTPS.

## [HTTP client]
An HTTP client is a program that requests web resources from servers using HTTP. Browsers like Chrome act as HTTP clients.
